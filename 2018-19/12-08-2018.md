# Freshers' Fair

- CompSoc will have a stall at the Academic Freshers' Fair on 26th September, no stall at the International one.
- We need merchandise for our stall, eg. laptop stickers.
- Advertise a general timeline of our future events so possible members know what to expect.
- The committee will take turns at the stand.
- We will need a carboard with pictures from events and cards with (QR code maybe) discord/facebook link.

# GIAG

- Gaming night in DEC10 Lab, Active Learning Lab and the VR Lab with pizza and refreshments.
- Tech talks and even project showcase.

# Otley Run during freshers' week

- We could have white T-shirts to write on. 

# Others

- We discussed about types of events we could have, such as programming tutorials starting with scratch/blueprints, monthly meetings about current projects for review and showcase, organising teams for hackathons, game nights, coffee and code evenings, course on retrogames, tech talks.
- Another idea was having a discord bot for keeping scores for our memebers and the highest one will get something at the end of the year.
- We discussed about having coding challenges monthly/weekly to get points for the discord ranking.
