# Ball

- Mitchell didn't show up hence we were unable to fully understand what was on offer from the engineering Ball.
- In conjunction with the survey we are leaning toward the engineering ball, though some concerns about the quality.
- The committee position for the faculty ball is to be reassigned to Luca as it is felt that he has more free time.

# Football

- Marketing thus far has been inadequate, we need more marketing for these events.
- Global emails from Jack could be used to create this.

# GIAG

- Zaeem will order refreshments on the day.
- Set up at 16:00

# AGM

- Finalise the roles before we break up.

# Hash Code

- Clarify numbers in order to gain sponsorship
